[View the live project here](https://charityhub.herokuapp.com/)

Charity Hub is an app that works as a research tool for those interested in supporting charities. The target audience is people looking to donate to, volunteer at, and keep up-to-date with specific charities of their choosing. The app functions as a one-stop-location for research into active charities on a global scale; as a searchable and filterable database of information about these charities; and resource for current news and facts about the featured charities.

This app was developed as part of Code Institute's Feb 2023 Hackathon for World NGO Day. The app was conceived, designed, developed and deployed by a team of 6 Code Institute students at various stages of learning, over the course of 5 days (February 16th-20th 2023).

## Project Management
We used several tools for project management during this hackathon:

- We created a main git branch that all of our individual development branches pulled to
- We used a Kanban board template from Github to manage our progress and timeline
- Our team was split into two to form one frontend and one backend team that collaborated together and assigned tasks to on another
- We used our slack channel to communicate effectively, including using polls and huddles to organise virtual meetings
- Half of our team worked by night and the other half by day to maximise development time
- Google drive and docs were used to create meeting agendas and minutes and to provide updates 

## User experience (UX)

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to learn what this website is about so that I understand its purpose.

2. As a user I want to be able to navigate the app easily and intuitively so I can use it efficiently. 

3. As a user, I want to see the featured charities, so that I can find out which I want to support.

4. As a user, I want to know who is responsible for the project, so that I can learn more about them.

5. As a user, I want to search for a charity that I have recently heard about, so that I can find out information about it.

6. As a user, I want to search for all the charities in a certain category, so that I can support the cause that is important to me.

7. As a user, I want to search for charities that have certain keywords attached to them, so that I can search for the charity that is best suited to me.

8. As a user, I want to find out where in the world the charity does outreach, so that I can make the choice to support either an international or local cause..

9. As a user, I want to find out what I certain charity does, so that I can decide if I want to support them.

10. As a user, I want to visit the website of a charity so that if I want to volunteer at or donate directly to a charity, I can get the information I need.

11. As a user, I want to stay up-to-date with current news related to the work that charities do so I can stay informed.

12. As a user I would like to get in touch with the owners of the app so that I can ask queries or request a charity is added to their database.

### Owner group

1. As an owner, I want to promote myself, so that users can find out more about me.

2. As an owner, I want to promote the app's social media, where I share information about charities and what is happening in that sector, so that users can stay up to date.

### Wireframes
Three project contributors were assigned the task of creating and presenting wireframes to the group. We each created wireframes with varying technologies, and presented them to the group on a slack huddle. As a team, we picked our favourite features from all three presentation and made sure they met the user and owner group criteria. As a result, a blend of these wireframes were used as a design for the project.

### Search Functionality
As a group we decided on the logic of the categories and keywords that would be used to present different charities to the user. We made sure this was in line with our user stories. 

### Colour Scheme

The app's colour scheme was devised using the colour palette generator [coolors](https://coolors.co/), and is consists of 5 colours: black, white, green, orange and grey. We were inspired by this colour scheme as it reinforces the friendly, fresh and optimistic branding that is important to the app's tone. It also has colours with appropriate contrast for legibility and accessibility, while also including brighter colours for guiding the user's eye to important features and actions. We did change the tones of these colours slightly from the original scheme to achieve a slightly more vibrant look, as the original coolors felt slightly to muted for the fresh vibrant branding we were trying to achieve.

### Typography

The Playfair font is the main font used throughout the website. It is crisp and easy to read, which is appropriate for legibility. It is also an interesting, rather than a standard font, encouraging intrigue in the user, encouraging them to engage in research on our app.

### Imagery

The favicon we utilised is a sprouting plant. We chose it because it symbolises the fresh optimistic outlook of our branding and makes sense with our colour scheme. It was sourced from
